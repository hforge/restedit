This is the RESTful editor, an utility to edit content in a CMS with
your desktop applications (e.g. Gimp, OpenOffice, vim, etc.)

An optimistic restful [1] mechanism based in timestamps is used to talk
with the server.  This mechanism uses HTTP/1.1, in particular the PUT
method and the If-Unmodified-Since header.  At least the Ikaaro [2] CMS
is known to support this mechanism and to work with restedit.

This software is a fork of zopeedit [3], the main difference is the
mechanism used to talk with the server (restful or not restful).
